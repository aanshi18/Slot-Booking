**SLOT BOOKING SYSTEM**

* PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  - Booking rooms to conduct events and academic sessions can be a bit hectic as we need to write mail to the admin to get the room. 
  - The SBS helps you book a room simply and also lets you know about the free slots for a particular room on a particular day.
  - It is a 3-user system: Admin, Faculty/Clubs.

* USERS:
  - Admin:
    * Can accept/reject one or many requests to book rooms at a particular date for a particular slot, with feedback.
    * Can view the calendar with the information about the booked slots.
  - Faculty/Clubs:
    * Can book rooms for particular slots for conducting lectures/events along with giving the description about the lecture/event.
    * The request to book room is accepted/rejected along with the explanation  visible.
    * Can view calendar in which the slots booked by other faculty/clubs are shown.
    
* UNIQUE FEATURE:

  - Calendar:
    * The calendar is displayed on a 7-day display mode such that the viewer can see the information about the slots roomwise, for a period of 7 days and for all time slots.
    * The calendar shows the slots booked by all the faculties/clubs in the entire week.
    * Slots can be booked at most the day before the event/lecture. One cannot book a slot in any room on the day of the event.
    * The calendar at the faculty/club side shows slots which are booked already.
    * The calendar at the admin side shows the information of the slots booked and the ones requested.

  - User Calendar:
    * The user can see the slots which are booked and which are empty and decide to book the slot on that basis.

  - Admin Calendar:
    * The admin can view the details of the slot booking along with details of event/lecture in the calendar.
